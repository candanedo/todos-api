# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Challenge


Imagine you need to build a simple todo list Ruby on Rails api, and you have to work off of the attached code base. The codebase was written by a very junior developer, and the code is also still incomplete. Your mission is to fix up the current code with best practices and add new code to make the user stories below work.

Your API needs to follow best practices and should be a JSON REST API. You should use a tool such as Postman (or similar) to develop your API, it's what I will use to test if everything is working. Feel free to use any Gems you need as well. Also feel free to modify/delete/add any methods as you’d like.

The api should support the creation of multiple users with their own accounts.

As a user I want to be able to:
- Create a new account
- Login to my account
- Create, update, and delete a task
- A task should have a title, a check to see if i’ve completed it, and I want to be able to add notes to it
- See a list of all of my tasks, as well as filter by whether or not a task has been completed
- I should not be able to see tasks of other users, just my own tasks
- See the details (title, etc.) for a particular task
- Retrieve a list of my completed tasks
- Retrieve a list of my uncompleted tasks
Bonus (only do this if you have enough time, not required):
- Write a couple of tests for your controllers using rspec
